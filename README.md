#Project 5
================================================
###What
Healthcare data 

###Why/How
Today, doctors, nurses & health professionals are limited in the level of care they can provide, because they can’t view complete, accurate health records. Doctors will be able to publish medical records safely on the blockchain and only authorized people will be able to access the data.
Medical institutions will be able to securely share data, no medical records will be lost. Test results will come on time and the probability of correct diagnosis and effective treatment will be higher. Blockchain is immutable, so nobody will be able to fake or lose data. Blockchain is decentralized, so the information will be stored not only in one datacenter, in this case - in different medical institutions.

###Functionalities/Success:

Doctor can add information about patient
Information will be available to view
Information will be non changeable
Patient will be able to see it’s data by entering personal code
